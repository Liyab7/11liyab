          <h2> <font color="white"> <p>Michael Jeffrey Jordan (born February 17, 1963) <br> Also known by his initials MJ, is an American businessman and former professional basketball player.
                He played fifteen seasons in the National Basketball Association (NBA) between 1984 and 2003, winning six NBA championships with the Chicago Bulls. He was integral in popularizing basketball and the NBA around the world in the 1980s and 1990s, becoming a global cultural icon. His profile on the NBA website states, "By acclamation, Michael Jordan is the greatest basketball player of all time
               <p> The Vancouver Grizzlies had the highest probability to win the NBA draft lottery, but since they were an expansion team along with the Toronto Raptors His dominance continued when in 2023, he recorded his 40,000 point scored. <p>"You have to make an impact as a sub."
                
                A locally known basketball prodigy since elementary school, Jordan was Mr. Basketball (high-school player of the year) two times while leading  Vincent-St. Mary High School to three Ohio state championships in his four years on the team. He became a national media sensation in his junior year after appearing on the cover of Sports Illustrated, where he was billed by the magazine as “The Chosen One.” James was the consensus national high-school player of the year in his senior season, and he was selected by the Cleveland Cavaliers with the first overall selection of the 2020 NBA draft.
