        <h2>   <font color="white"> <p>Desmond Michael Bane(born June 25, 1998) <br> Is an American professional basketball player for the Memphis Grizzlies of the National Basketball Association (NBA).
                He played college basketball for the TCU Horned Frogs. Bane was selected in the first round of the 2020 NBA draft with the 30th overall pick, and was named to the NBA All-Rookie Second Team in his first year with Memphis.
               <p> After he was born, Bane, his mother Marissa, and his sister often moved around. When he was two years old, he started living with his great-grandparents, who raised him in Richmond, Indiana, for the rest of his childhood. At age 13, Bane discovered that his father, Etieno Ekiko, lived in Nigeria. Bane focused on baseball until eighth grade, with his great-grandfather coaching at the youth level, and also played football and soccer. <p>"You have to make an impact as a sub."
                
                A locally known basketball prodigy since elementary school, Desmond was Mr. Basketball (high-school player of the year) two times while leading  Vincent-St. Mary High School to three Ohio state championships in his four years on the team. He became a national media sensation in his junior year after appearing on the cover of Sports Illustrated, where he was billed by the magazine as “The Chosen One.” Desmond was the consensus national high-school player of the year in his senior season, and he was selected by the Cleveland Cavaliers with the first overall selection of the 2023 NBA draft.
