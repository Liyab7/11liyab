  <h2>  <p><b>Hearts of Oak have successfully retained their top-flight status in the Ghana
         Premier League after earning a vital 3-2 victory over Bechem United on the final
          day of the competition.</b></p>
          <p>Heading into the decisive match, the Phobians were teetering on the brink of relegation,
             sitting 15th on the table with 42 points, just one point above the relegation zone occupied
              by Great Olympics in 16th place.
            The match at Nana Fosu Gyeablour Park saw Bechem United take an early lead in the 29th minute
             through Emmanuel Owusu.
            However, Hearts of Oak quickly responded with an equalizer from Kofi Agbesimah just three minutes
             later. Despite their spirited effort, the Phobians found themselves behind again when Bismark
              Edjeodji netted for Bechem United after the break.</p>
              <p>But Hearts of Oak refused to give up, and their persistence paid off as they
                scored two goals in the final 15 minutes to snatch the win. Substitute
                Isaac Mensah scored the equalizer in the 75th minute before Frederick Ansah 
                sealed the victory with a stunning strike in the 88th minute.In a dramatic turnaround,
                 Hearts of Oak found their moment of relief and triumph. Kevin Osei Assibey and Yaw Baafi scored 
                 two quick goals in the space of four minutes, sealing a crucial 3-2 win for the Phobians.

                This victory lifted Hearts of Oak to 13th place on the table, firmly securing their place in 
                the Ghana Premier League for another season and alleviating the fears of relegation that had loomed over them.
                
                The win was a testament to the team’s resilience and determination, ensuring they remain a part of Ghana’s
                 top-flight football. More details on the match and reactions from the team will follow.
                
                Last season, the Phobians found themselves in a similar situation managing to finish 12th after 
                avoiding defeat in their final game.     <br>       <div class="btn">
