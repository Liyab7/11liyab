<h1 class="fball">France 'uncertain' if Mbappe can face Netherlands</h1>

    <h2>     <p>France coach Didier Deschamps says he is "uncertain" if Kylian
        Mbappe will be fit to face the Netherlands in their Nations League
        match on Sunday. Mbappe, 23, was forced off with a thigh injury
        during the 2-0 win over Austria on Thursday. Deschamps said the
        forward would undergo further tests on Friday to determine the
        extent of the injury. "We'll have to wait and see how he feels
        tomorrow," Deschamps said. "We'll do some tests and then we'll
        know more."</p>
      <p>Kylian Mbappe "remains uncertain" to play in France's meeting with the Netherlands after breaking his nose in their opening win at Euro 2024.

            The 25-year-old striker was forced off during Monday's 1-0 victory over Austria after his face struck opponent Kevin Danso's shoulder in the follow-through from an aerial challenge.
            
            Mbappe was taken to Dusseldorf hospital, where the break was confirmed, before returning to the national team's camp.
            
            The French Football Federation (FFF) said a new update on their captain will be provided on Wednesday.
            
            Mbappe, who played his part in France's winner against Austria as his cross was headed into his own net by defender Max Wober, does not require surgery for the injury.
            
            The FFF said a protective mask will be made for the forward.
            
            In a news conference following Monday's game, France boss Didier Deschamps said the talismanic Mbappe was "not doing well".
            
            He has scored 47 goals in 80 appearances for his country, although he has not scored a goal at a European Championship.
            
            He will join Real Madrid after the tournament, when his Paris St-Germain contract expires.<br>
