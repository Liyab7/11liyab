                A locally known basketball prodigy since elementary school, James was named Ohio's Mr. Basketball (high-school player of the year) three times while leading Akron's St. Vincent-St. Mary High School to three Ohio state championships in his four years on the team. He became a national media sensation in his junior year after appearing on the cover of Sports Illustrated, where he was billed by the magazine as “The Chosen One.” James was the consensus national high-school player of the year in his senior season, and he was selected by the Cleveland Cavaliers with the first overall selection of the 2003 NBA draft.
